   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Once installed, verify the installation by running:
   ```sh
   rustc --version
   ```
   You should see the installed Rust version.

## Running the Server

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or create a new directory for the server code.
   ```sh
   cd src/servers/rust-server/juancho
   ```
1. Save the server code provided into a file named `main.rs` inside the project directory.

1. Initialize a new Rust project (optional but recommended for better structure):
  
1. Run the server using Cargo:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

1. The server will start on port `5012`. You can verify that the server is running by accessing the following URL in your browser or using a tool like `curl`:
   ```
   http://localhost:5012/users
   ```

3. **POST /users** - Add a new user.
4. **PUT /users/{id}** - Update a user by ID.
5. **PATCH /users/{id}** - Update the hours worked for a user by adding a value.
6. **DELETE /users/{id}** - Delete a user by ID.
7. **DELETE /users** - Delete all users.
