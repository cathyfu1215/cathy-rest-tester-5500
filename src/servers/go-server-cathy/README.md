Hi, this is my implementation of the backend in Go.

## Install Go

- download Go from https://go.dev/dl/
- follow the instructions there

#### Verify the installation
```
go version
```


## Run the server

Don't forget to navigate to the right path!
```
cd go-server-cathy

```
Go will take care of dependencies when you run the project.
```
go build
go run main.go
```

Note: we will be using port 5005 and this is also indicated in the frontend.


## Run the frontend

open a new terminal, navigate to the root of this whole repo
```
cd cathy-rest-tester-5500
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting
If you see other errors, follow the instructions :D
